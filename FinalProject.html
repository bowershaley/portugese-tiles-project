      <p>
        Even though tiles are <span><strong>originally from Egypt</strong></span>, they were first brought to
        Portugal by the Arabs, in the 13th century at the time of their
        invasion, which also helped shaped Portugalâ€™s culture. However, it was
        in the time of King D. Manuel I that tiles were first introduced to
        Portugal. They were, in fact, imported from Seville after the Kingâ€™s
        visit to Spain. It is said that he was so enchanted by these tilesâ€™
        brightness, that he had to bring some back to Portugal to decorate his
        palace walls â€“ the National Palace of Sintra. <br />
        Initially, Portuguese tiles were used inside most buildings. As they
        were only bought by wealthy families, it is understandable that they
        didnâ€™t use them outside as much. Over time, the tendency was to use them
        in every buildingâ€™s construction, so it is possible to see them almost
        everywhere. The decoration itself depends on the artist, or the
        architect and constructor of the building, since you can decorate a
        house with equal, coloured designs or pieces of art.
